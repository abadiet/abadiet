### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a French engineering student at [ISAE-ENSMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_de_m%C3%A9canique_et_d%27a%C3%A9rotechnique). My favorite fields are machine learning and computer graphics.

# Projects

## [Distributed Computing *(2023)*](https://github.com/titofra/Distributed-Computing)

Basic versatile C library for distributed computing. [Distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) refers to a network of computers working together to solve a problem or complete a task, instead of a single computer handling all the processing. The workload is divided among multiple machines, allowing for faster and more efficient processing.

## [Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) *(2022)*](https://github.com/titofra/NEAT)

C library for evolving neural networks with NEAT. [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) is a machine learning technique used to evolve artificial neural networks. This algorithm is often used for complex tasks such as game playing and robotics, where traditional hand-designed neural networks may not be effective.
