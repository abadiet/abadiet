### Hi there üëã

I'm a French MSc student in Aeraunotics and Space, specializing in Computer Science for Avionics at [ISAE-ENSMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_de_m%C3%A9canique_et_d%27a%C3%A9rotechnique).

# Projects available on GitHub

## [:brain: Polymorphic NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies with Memory (PNEATM) *(2023)*](https://github.com/titofra/PNEATM)

Pure C++ library for a machine learning technique designed to evolve artificial neural networks. PNEATM offers several advantages such as handling various data types, supporting multiple data types simultaneously, utilizing multiple activation functions, dynamically evolving activation functions, and accessing previous processed data.

## [:robot: Distributed Computing *(2023)*](https://github.com/titofra/Distributed-Computing)

Basic versatile C library for distributed computing with dedicated os. [Distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) refers to a network of computers working together to solve a problem or complete a task, instead of a single computer handling all the processing. The workload is divided among multiple machines, allowing for faster and more efficient processing.

## [:brain: Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) *(2022)*](https://github.com/titofra/NEAT)

C++ library for evolving neural networks with NEAT. [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) is a machine learning technique used to evolve artificial neural networks. This algorithm is often used for complex tasks such as game playing and robotics, where traditional hand-designed neural networks may not be effective.
